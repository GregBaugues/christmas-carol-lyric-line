LITTLE DRUMMER BOY
(RPPP = "rum pum pum pum")

Come they told me
Pa RPPP
A new born King to see

Our finest gifts we bring
Pa RPPP
To lay before the king
Pa RPPP
RPPP
RPPP 

So to honor Him
Pa RPPP
When we come

Little baby
Pa RPPP
I am a poor boy too
Pa RPPP
I have no gift to bring
Pa RPPP
That's fit to give our King
Pa RPPP
RPPP
RPPP

Shall I play for you
Pa RPPP
On my drum

Mary nodded
Pa RPPP
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa RPPP
I played my drum for Him
Pa RPPP
I played my best for Him
Pa RPPP
RPPP
RPPP

Then He smiled at me
Pa RPPP
Me and my drum

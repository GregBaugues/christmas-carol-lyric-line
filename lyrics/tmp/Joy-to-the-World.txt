JOY TO THE WORLD

Joy to The world the Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Let ev'ry heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing (x3)

Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy (x3)

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love (x2)
And wonder wonders of His love
